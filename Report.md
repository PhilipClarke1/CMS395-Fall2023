The collaborative effort of our team materialized into "Fortfight," a 2D fighter game set in an imaginative world of fortresses. Our motivation was to create an entertaining and accessible gaming experience suitable for players of all skill levels.

## Target Users:
Our primary audience is casual gamers, and our objective is to deliver a simple yet engaging gameplay experience. The game unfolds in a vibrant world with exotic fighting grounds as the backdrop for intense battles. In "Fortfight," the goal is to accumulate points and defeat the NPC opponent.

## Controls:
- Movement: Arrow keys or WASD
- Attacks: Keys (e.g., A, S, D)
- Special Moves: Combination of keys
- Jump: Spacebar
- Pause/Menu: Esc key

## Task Distribution:
- Thomas Garvin: Character and level design
- Philip Clarke: Project management
- Trevor Dorfman: Game development, coding, and mechanics

## Game Development:

The development of "Fortfight" unfolded incrementally, with each team member contributing to various aspects. In the initial update, Trevor focused on the main menu and scene gateways, Thomas worked on the rule set and tutorial page, and Philip designed the starting scene and backgrounds.

Progressing to the second update, Thomas added interactive elements, while Philip introduced the protagonist with movements and animations. Trevor initiated the implementation of the computer antagonist for level one.

In the final update, Thomas introduced a health bar, and Philip implemented interaction codes for the protagonist and antagonist, affecting the health bar. Trevor added a path to a new level, and Philip incorporated the functionality for advancing to the next level.

## Discussion and Future Work:

The project was challenging but provided valuable lessons in teamwork, C#, and Unity. These experiences will better prepare us for future endeavors. Looking ahead, we plan to expand "Fortfight" by introducing additional characters, levels, and incorporating multiplayer functionality. We appreciate your support and hope you enjoy playing "Fortfight" as much as we enjoyed creating it!
